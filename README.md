## Hi, I'm [Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-wentzel/) 👋.

I currently work in Trading at DWS Group and study Banking & Finance at [Frankfurt School of Finance & Management](https://www.frankfurt-school.de/en), graduating in 2027/28.

I'm passionate about quant trading, neurotech and astronomy. Feel free to reach out!

#### Current projects
- [OptiCalc](https://github.com/PaulWentzel1/OptiCalc) - An intuitive and versatile Python-based options pricing library. Designed as a niche midpoint between messy Excel/VBA pricers and QuantLib-type libraries.
